# Hogwarts-Paper-AR

Developed an iOS application using Swift that utilizes AR-Kit framework to construct and display a three-dimensional newspaper and implemented advanced techniques such as object detection, surface tracking, and live estimation to generate a real-time projection within the 3D newspaper.

Utilized AR SceneKit to configure and customize the 3D scenes while simultaneously implementing physics simulations and lighting effects to enhance the overall visual experience. Leveraged SpriteKit framework, to integrate and play relevant video clips within the rendered newspaper.
